# Project Management Skills for AI Agents

A collection of reusable AI agent skills for project delivery work: project context setup, scoping, status communication, delivery execution, and project hygiene.

This repository is designed for AI coding agents and assistant workflows that support project delivery, implementation, and operational execution. It is intended to work with tools that support the [Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io), including OpenCode, Claude Code, and compatible agent environments.

Built by [Lola](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lolaojabowale) at [Lunch Pail Labs](https://lunchpaillabs.com).

Want a managed setup for these workflows in real client delivery environments? See [PailFlow](https://pailflow.com).

Contributions are welcome. 

## What are skills?

Skills are directory-based instruction packs that help AI agents recognize and execute specialized workflows. Each skill lives in its own folder and includes a `SKILL.md` file with instructions, usage triggers, and optional references, scripts, or assets.

## State of the repository

- Current maturity: baseline complete, with full 27-skill workflow coverage
- Core pattern: use lane routers to choose focused sub-workflows and return decision-ready handoffs
- Published skills today: `composio`, `pm-initiate`, `pm-initiate-project-context`, `pm-initiate-budget`, `pm-initiate-problem-framing`, `pm-initiate-stakeholder-map`, `pm-initiate-charter-and-viability-gate`, `pm-plan`, `pm-plan-requirements-brief`, `pm-plan-scope-schedule-baseline`, `pm-plan-roadmap-and-prioritization`, `pm-plan-raid-raci-decision-setup`, `pm-execute`, `pm-execute-work-package-coordination`, `pm-execute-iteration-cycle`, `pm-execute-change-control`, `pm-execute-dependency-and-handoff`, `pm-monitor`, `pm-monitor-ticket-triage`, `pm-monitor-status`, `pm-monitor-budget`, `pm-monitor-risk-escalation`, `pm-close`, `pm-close-acceptance-signoff`, `pm-close-handover-transition`, `pm-close-lessons-learned`, `pm-close-benefits-review-and-archive`
- Strongest current lane: balanced baseline coverage across all lanes
- Planned growth path: quality refinement, eval coverage, and iterative hardening

## Repository focus

This repo is meant to cover project-management-adjacent work such as:

- ticket triage
- scoping and estimation
- project status updates
- retrospectives
- stakeholder communication
- delivery planning
- handoffs and launch readiness
- project hygiene and follow-through

Over time, these skills should map to the kinds of real operational work project managers, delivery managers, implementation teams, and professional services teams do every week.

## Project lifecycle lanes

To keep the collection easy to navigate, skills are organized by standard project lifecycle lanes:

- `initiate` - define intent, clarify problem statements, and establish delivery readiness
- `plan` - shape requirements, scope work, and prepare implementation artifacts
- `execute` - run work through agreed stages and handoffs
- `monitor` - track status, risks, blockers, and control points
- `close` - complete handoff, capture learnings, and formalize closure

### Naming convention for new skills

For new skills, prefer:

`pm-<phase>-<noun-or-object>`

Examples:

- `pm-initiate-project-context`
- `pm-plan-scope-outline`
- `pm-execute-stage-gate-workflow`
- `pm-monitor-status-risks`
- `pm-close-lessons-learned`

Published skill names should remain stable once released. Existing skills can be mapped to lanes in docs without renaming.

## Planned structure

```text
skills/
  skill-name/
    SKILL.md
    references/
    scripts/
    assets/

examples/
```

## How skills work together

This repository follows a context-first model similar to the best multi-skill collections.

- `pm-initiate-project-context` is the foundation skill
- Other PM skills should read `.agents/project-context.md` first
- This keeps delivery context consistent across handoffs, updates, and execution tasks

As new skills are added, they should reference project context before generating plans, updates, or action items.

## Available skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [composio](skills/composio/) | Handles connected-tool workflows through Composio by choosing the right external system, checking connection state, using the smallest reliable tool path, and returning concise provenance with the specific records that support the answer. |
| [pm-initiate-project-context](skills/pm-initiate-project-context/) | Creates or updates `.agents/project-context.md` so agents can reuse stakeholder context, delivery expectations, tools/access, risks, and source-of-truth links across project work. |
| [pm-initiate-budget](skills/pm-initiate-budget/) | Creates or updates a lightweight `.agents/project-budget.md` tracker with one row per project and simple budget-monitoring columns (baseline, spend, forecast, variance, status, owner, and notes). |
| [pm-initiate](skills/pm-initiate/) | Initiate-stage router that selects the right setup mode (context, lightweight budget setup, problem framing, stakeholder mapping, or charter/viability gate) and returns a plan-ready handoff. |
| [pm-initiate-problem-framing](skills/pm-initiate-problem-framing/) | Initiate-stage subskill for defining the core problem, affected stakeholders, success criteria, boundaries, and assumptions before planning. |
| [pm-initiate-stakeholder-map](skills/pm-initiate-stakeholder-map/) | Initiate-stage subskill for mapping stakeholders, decision authority, RACI signals, and escalation paths. |
| [pm-initiate-charter-and-viability-gate](skills/pm-initiate-charter-and-viability-gate/) | Initiate-stage subskill for charter readiness and go/go-with-conditions/no-go viability decisions with explicit gaps. |
| [pm-plan](skills/pm-plan/) | Plan-stage router that selects planning mode (requirements, baseline, roadmap, or RAID/RACI/decision controls) and returns an execution-ready summary. |
| [pm-plan-requirements-brief](skills/pm-plan-requirements-brief/) | Plan-stage subskill for producing a concise requirements brief with acceptance boundaries, priorities, and open decisions. |
