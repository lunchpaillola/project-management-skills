name: pm-monitor-ticket-triage
description: Use when the user needs to run intake triage and response operations for incoming work (tickets, comments, client feedback, bug reports, support asks). This skill classifies urgency/impact, gathers missing context, drafts response comments, routes work into tasks, assigns owners, and drives items toward closure. Also use when the user asks what needs a response now, what should be converted into tasks, or how to clean up noisy backlog/support intake across Jira, Linear, ClickUp, Notion, Trello, or spreadsheets.

# PM Monitor Ticket Triage

You run a repeatable intake-triage workflow that converts messy intake into a clear response and execution queue.

This skill can be invoked directly, or selected via the `pm-monitor` entry-point workflow.

Primary goal: make each item response-ready, owner-ready, and execution-ready.

Communication style contract: this skill owns triage analysis, routing decisions, response drafting inputs, and required findings. `pm-communication-style` owns the final presentation of any user-facing answer.

## Workflow

Before executing, copy this checklist and keep it updated in your working notes:

```text
Ticket Triage Progress
- [ ] Step 1 complete: triage source and objective confirmed
- [ ] Step 2 complete: available tools and sources confirmed
- [ ] Step 3 complete: triage rubric selected
- [ ] Step 4 complete: items normalized and grouped
- [ ] Step 5 complete: missing context and blockers surfaced
- [ ] Step 6 complete: response and routing actions prepared
- [ ] Step 7 complete: closure signals and summary generated
```

Do not skip steps.

### Step 1: Confirm triage source and objective

1. Ask for or infer the source of intake items:
   - tracker export
   - markdown notes
   - meeting notes
   - chat/email thread
   - spreadsheet table
2. Confirm triage objective:
   - sprint planning intake
   - urgent bug sweep
   - client feedback cleanup
   - backlog hygiene pass
3. If `.agents/project-context.md` exists, read it first to align with:
   - stakeholder expectations
   - delivery phase
   - risk tolerances
   - communication style

If no source items are provided, return `blocked` with the minimum input needed.

### Step 2: Confirm available tools and sources

Identify what triage sources are available now:

- tracker tools (for example Jira/Linear/ClickUp)
- communication sources (for example comments, Slack, email)
- exported or local artifacts (markdown, CSV, docs)

If source coverage is incomplete, request the minimum structure needed:

- item id or title
- source text (ticket/comment/request)
- current state/status (if known)
- owner and due/review date (if known)

If no usable source data exists, return `blocked` with exact required inputs.

### Step 3: Select and apply triage rubric

Use this default rubric unless the user provides another one:

- **Classification**: `bug`, `feature`, `task`, `question`, `dependency`, `change-request`
- **Priority**: `P1` (urgent), `P2` (high), `P3` (normal), `P4` (low)
- **Severity** (for incidents/bugs): `critical`, `major`, `minor`, `cosmetic`
- **Confidence**: `high`, `medium`, `low`
- **State recommendation**: `ready`, `needs-info`, `defer`, `escalate`

Rules:

1. Preserve source wording in raw issue descriptions.
2. Do not invent facts.
3. Mark unknowns explicitly as `TBD`.
4. If an item is ambiguous, set `confidence: low` and explain why.

### Step 4: Normalize items

For each item, produce a normalized record with:

- item id (or generated local id)
- title
- source link/path (if available)
- classification
- priority
- severity (when applicable)
- owner (`TBD` if missing)
- due/review date (`TBD` if missing)
- dependencies
- short problem statement
- recommended next action
- confidence

If duplicate or overlapping items are found:

- keep one canonical item
- list merged references
- record merge rationale in notes

### Step 5: Surface blockers and missing context

For each item, check for missing fields that block delivery:

- no clear owner
- no acceptance criteria
- no reproducible steps (for bug)
- no target date/review date
- unclear scope boundary

Any item with missing critical fields must be marked `needs-info` and include one concrete follow-up question.

### Step 6: Produce final triage outputs

For each `ready` or `needs-info` item, produce:

- recommended channel (`ticket comment`, `client update`, `internal note`)
- response draft (short, factual, next-step oriented)
- task conversion decision (`no-task`, `create-task`, `link-existing-task`)
- routed owner and due/review date (`TBD` if unknown)

Response drafting rules:

1. Keep tone collaborative and non-defensive.
2. State what is known, what is pending, and what happens next.
3. If more info is needed, ask one concrete question.
4. Do not promise timelines not supported by evidence.

### Step 7: Closure and signal summary

Create closure guidance for each item:

- **Close now**: enough evidence and action complete
- **Keep open**: waiting on owner/input/dependency
- **Escalate**: unresolved decision or high risk

Each item must end with one explicit next state.

After triage, hand the findings to `pm-communication-style` for presentation.

What this skill must determine before presentation:

- triage objective used
- tools and sources used
- human-readable source labels paired with direct links when available
- rubric used (default or custom)
- total item count and counts by recommendation (`ready`, `needs-info`, `defer`, `escalate`)
- prioritized queue with top items, rationale, owner, and next action
- explicit list of items blocked by missing context, with one concrete follow-up question each
- response queue with short comment drafts and task conversion decisions
- deferred or parked items with review dates when known
- escalations with target and decision-needed timing when known
- closure summary (`close now`, `keep open`, `escalate` counts)
- tool or data gaps that reduced confidence

Do not force ordered sections or tables here unless the communication layer decides they genuinely help the user.

## Optional adapter modes

If user asks for tool-specific output, map the same triage decisions into that format without changing core logic:

- Jira/Linear/ClickUp: status/priority fields + labels + assignee suggestions
- Notion/Trello: board columns + card properties
- Spreadsheet: flat CSV-style table with one row per item

Adapter rule: core triage decision quality comes first; tool formatting comes second.

## Output contract

Always return:

1. triage objective used
2. tools and sources used
3. rubric used (default or custom)
4. count by recommendation (`ready`, `needs-info`, `defer`, `escalate`)
5. top 3 items by urgency with one-line rationale each
6. explicit list of items blocked by missing context
7. response queue with comment drafts
8. closure summary (`close now`, `keep open`, `escalate` counts)
9. tool/data gaps that reduced confidence

## Rules

- Keep language short, specific, and operational.
- Prefer decision-ready outputs over narrative summaries.
- Preserve direct links when present, but prefer readable source labels over raw IDs in user-facing output.
- Keep unknowns visible as `TBD`.
- Never auto-close or drop items without recording where they went.
- Treat this as a monitor/operations workflow: triage is incomplete unless response, routing, and closure intent are explicit.
