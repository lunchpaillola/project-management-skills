# PM Monitor Risk Escalation

You run a monitor-stage risk escalation workflow.

Primary goal: convert risk and blocker signals into explicit escalation decisions and follow-through.

Communication style contract: this skill owns escalation analysis, tolerance reasoning, and required findings. `pm-communication-style` owns the final presentation of any user-facing answer.

## Workflow

Before executing, copy this checklist and keep it updated in your working notes:

```text
Risk Escalation Progress
- [ ] Step 1 complete: escalation objective confirmed
- [ ] Step 2 complete: available tools and source quality checked
- [ ] Step 3 complete: risks, issues, and tolerance signals synthesized
- [ ] Step 4 complete: escalation candidates and decision paths identified
- [ ] Step 5 complete: owner actions and review checkpoints set
- [ ] Step 6 complete: risk-escalation output returned
```

## Step 1: Confirm escalation objective

Identify what escalation question needs answering now:

- what is stuck and why
- what is likely to breach tolerance
- who must decide next and by when

If `.agents/project-context.md` exists, read it first.

## Step 2: Check tools and source quality

Use strongest available sources:

1. status updates, RAID logs, and dependency records
2. tracker states, stale items, and blocker comments
3. decision logs, approval queues, and handoff notes

Classify source quality as `high`, `medium`, or `low`.

If sources are partial, continue with explicit assumptions.
Return `blocked` only when no usable risk or blocker signal exists.

When source quality is `medium` or `low` (but not `blocked`), continue with a best-effort escalation view and request exactly one concrete missing source that would most improve confidence.

## Step 3: Synthesize risk, issue, and tolerance signals

Separate:

- active issues (happening now)
- forward risks (likely to happen)
- dependency and ownership fragility

For each critical item, assess tolerance pressure as:

- `within-tolerance`
- `approaching-breach`
- `breach-likely`

Do not invent owners or deadlines.

## Step 4: Identify escalation candidates and decision paths

Escalate items when one or more apply:

- no owner follow-through
- unresolved blocker beyond expected review point
- dependency delay threatens milestone integrity
- decision needed is outside current team's authority

For each candidate, define escalation target and decision needed.

## Step 5: Set owner actions and checkpoints

Define:

- immediate mitigation action
- escalation action and owner
- decision deadline/review checkpoint
- fallback if decision is delayed

For each escalated item, make the fallback explicit in the returned actions (not only in working notes).

Mark unknowns as `TBD`.

## Step 6: Return risk escalation findings

After analysis, hand the findings to `pm-communication-style` for presentation.

What this skill must determine before presentation:

- escalation objective
- tools or data sources actually used
- human-readable source labels paired with direct links when available
- missing tools or data gaps when relevant
- overall escalation signal: `stable` | `watch` | `escalate-now` | `blocked`
- top tolerance pressure
- what needs attention now
- source quality and one best missing source when confidence is below `high`
- escalation actions with owners, due dates, and fallback paths when known
- unknowns as `TBD` when needed
- follow-ups or next escalation steps when useful

Do not force a wrapper report shape here. The communication layer should decide how much structure the user sees.

## Rules

- Keep output concise, operational, and decision-ready.
- Never collapse active issues into generic risk language.
- Keep unknowns explicit as `TBD`.
- If confidence is below `high`, ask for one concrete missing source only.
