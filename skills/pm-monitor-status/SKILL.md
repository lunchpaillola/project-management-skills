description: "Use when the user needs a monitor-stage status rollup for active delivery work: current project state, what changed, what is at risk, decisions needed, and who owns next follow-through. Also use when the user asks for a standup-ready update, leadership snapshot, or cross-functional status summary from PM tools, notes, and operating signals. This skill is RAG/RAID grounded and should be used whenever status needs to be decision-ready with explicit escalation signals."

# PM Monitor Status

You run a monitor-stage status workflow that turns scattered delivery signals into a decision-ready status output.

Primary goal: answer "where do things stand right now, what needs attention, and what happens next?" with clear ownership and follow-through.

Status writing rule: make the opening lines carry the report. Leaders should understand state and ask without scrolling.

RAG/RAID operating rule:

- express delivery state as RAG (`green`, `yellow`, `red`, `blocked`)
- maintain a concise RAID view (`risks`, `assumptions`, `issues`, `dependencies`)
- map each red/yellow signal to an owner, next action, and escalation trigger

Communication style contract: this skill owns status analysis, RAID reasoning, and required ownership signals. `pm-communication-style` owns the final presentation of any user-facing answer.

## Workflow

Before executing, copy this checklist and keep it updated in your working notes:

```text
Status Progress
- [ ] Step 1 complete: status objective and audience confirmed
- [ ] Step 2 complete: available sources and signal quality confirmed
- [ ] Step 3 complete: project state and RAG signal synthesized
- [ ] Step 4 complete: RAID items and owner gaps identified
- [ ] Step 5 complete: decisions and next milestones clarified
- [ ] Step 6 complete: status output returned
```

Do not skip steps.

## Step 1: Confirm status objective and audience

Identify what the user needs now:

- standup-ready team update
- stakeholder or leadership rollup
- project health snapshot before a meeting
- cross-functional follow-through check

If `.agents/project-context.md` exists, read it first.

Set audience tone and detail level:

- team-level: specific tasks and owner actions
- leadership-level: concise signal, major risks, and decision asks

Do not decide final wording or opener shape here. Hand the findings to `pm-communication-style`.

## Step 2: Confirm sources and signal quality

Use the strongest available sources in this order:

1. PM system records (Jira, Linear, ClickUp, Asana, Trello)
2. latest status notes or meeting summaries
3. delivery artifacts (milestone plan, backlog views, release notes)
4. communication signals (Slack, comments, email threads)

Classify source quality:

- `high`: PM records plus recent status signal
- `medium`: PM records or status notes, but one side is weak
- `low`: narrative-only or partial context

If data is incomplete, continue with what exists and list the minimum missing input to improve reliability.

Return `blocked` only when no usable project-status signal exists.

## Step 3: Synthesize current project state and RAG signal

Build a concise status signal:

- current state: `green`, `yellow`, `red`, or `blocked`
- what changed since the previous visible checkpoint
- what needs attention now

Prefer outcomes over activity logs. Report movement in terms of delivered impact, risk reduction, or decision progress, not meeting cadence.

Use these default status heuristics unless a project-specific rubric is provided:

- `green`: no material blockers, plan variance appears recoverable within existing owners and timeline
- `yellow`: one or more meaningful risks, delays, or owner gaps need active management this cycle
- `red`: delivery objective is at material risk without immediate intervention, replan, or escalation
- `blocked`: essential source signal is missing or critical dependency makes progress impossible now

Use source facts first, then inference. Keep them separate.

Source facts include:

- open vs completed work movement
- milestone or deliverable state
- newly opened high-priority items
- recorded blockers or dependency delays

Inferred signals include:

- likely schedule pressure
- coordination risk
- follow-through fragility

Do not invent owners, due dates, or completion percentages.

## Step 4: Identify RAID items and owner gaps

Surface the smallest set of issues that drive outcomes:

- **Risks**: probable future problems not yet realized
- **Assumptions**: conditions believed true that affect execution
- **Issues**: active blockers/problems happening now
- **Dependencies**: external prerequisites, approvals, or handoffs
- owner gaps (`TBD` when unknown)

Each flagged issue must include a next action and explicit next state.

Risk quality gate:

- treat risks without owner, trigger, and mitigation as worries; keep them out of the main report until those fields exist

Do not collapse risk and issue into one bucket. If an item is happening now, classify it as an issue.

Keep source facts and inference separate in working analysis. Only surface the inference in the final message when it changes the decision, action, or escalation path.

## Step 5: Clarify decisions and next milestones

List:

- decisions needed now
- near-term milestones or checkpoints
- what each owner should do next

If a decision owner is unclear, mark `TBD` and suggest the responsible role.

## Step 6: Return the status findings

After analysis, hand the findings to `pm-communication-style` for final presentation.

What this skill must determine before presentation:

- current state: `green`, `yellow`, `red`, or `blocked`
- one-line reason for current state
- what changed or moved this period
- what needs attention now
- the smallest useful set of RAID items
- one explicit decision, owner, or next action near the top when applicable
- for `yellow`, `red`, or `blocked`, one explicit owner-action-escalation package near the top
- sources to drill down, using human-readable labels with direct links when available
- minimum missing input when confidence is limited

Include RAID type as `[R]`, `[A]`, `[I]`, or `[D]` when useful, but do not force tables if a short bullet is clearer.

If `blocked`, say so plainly and include:

- one concrete missing source
- why it matters
- best next step to unblock

## Rules

- Keep output operational and concise.
- Prefer decision-ready bullets over narrative blocks. Use tables only when they genuinely improve clarity.
- Keep the top lines fully stand-alone: project state+reason, explicit ask, and current status/movement.
- Keep asks near the top in bold with a date.
- For `yellow`, `red`, or `blocked`, make one owner-action-escalation package explicit near the top instead of leaving follow-through implied.
- Keep the report to one phone screen when possible.
- Use plain language and highlight only the few words that matter for skim.
- Avoid proof-of-work phrasing (for example "held sync" or "kicked off review") unless tied to an outcome.
- Keep unknowns explicit as `TBD`.
- When source quality is `medium` or `low`, surface the minimum missing input in the final message.
- Do not auto-close items.
- Preserve source references and direct links when provided, but prefer readable labels over raw IDs in the final output.
- For `yellow` or `red`, include one explicit escalation trigger.
- Call `yellow`/`red` early when warranted; do not green-wash uncertain status.
- Prefer one or two RAID items in the final output unless more are necessary to explain the state.
